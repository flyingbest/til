# Data Wrangling

Data munging or data wrangling is loosely defined as the process of manually converting or mapping data from one "raw" form into another format that allows for more convenient consumption of the data with the help of semi-automated tools. This may include further munging, data visualization, data aggregation, training a statistical model, as well as many other potential uses. Data munging as a process typically follows a set of general steps which begin with extracting the data in a raw form from the data source, "munging" the raw data using algorithms (e.g. sorting) or parsing the data into predefined data structures, and finally depositing the resulting content into a data sink for storage and future use.
A data wrangler is the person performing the wrangling.

Simply, **Data Wrangling is the process of cleaning and unifying messy and complex data sets for easy access and analysis.**
