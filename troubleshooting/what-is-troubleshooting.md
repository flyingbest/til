# What is Troubleshooting?

I knew roughly what the troubleshooting was. It's like a debugging in software. It's like a solving problems. But I want to know about exactly definition. Let's learn about troubleshooting.

Reference by [wikipedia/Troubleshooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubleshooting).

Troubleshooting is a form of problem solving, often applied to repair failed products or processes on a machine or a system. It is a logical, systematic search for the source of a problem in order to solve it, and make the product or process operational again. Troubleshooting is needed to identify the symptoms. Determining the most likely cause is a process of elimination--eliminating potential causes of a problem. Finally, troubleshooing requires confirmation that the solution restores the product or process to its working state.

**The process of solving a problem or determining a problem to an issue.** Troubleshooting often involves the process of elimination, where a technician will follow a set of steps to determine the problem or resolve the problem.

The goal of troubleshooting is to try to isolate the problem by elminating the possible problems one by one.
